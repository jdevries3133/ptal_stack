Items to complete for this thing to be somewhat viable:

- [ ] Tokens need to at least have a timestamp in them so that every newly
      issued token is unique, and so that some token expiry can be easily added as
      needed
- [ ] Configure CI/CD to a sane prod environment
- [ ] Place common `uri` config items in common, configure client `get_uri` and
      server CORS configs to consume it
